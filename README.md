# MetaWear App for iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS by MBIENTLAB

### This app supports granular analysis of raw MetaWear sensor data. (For a simpler workflow for acquiring streamed or logged MetaWear sensor data, try the MetaBase app.)

## Looking for sample code snippets?
For using, configuring, and connecting to MetaWears, try: `Common/Presentation/ViewModels/Implementations/`. These objects are written imperatively for UIKit/AppKit. For a sample use with SwiftUI views, these VMs call delegate `ObservableObjects` suffixed with `SUIVC`.

For C++ constants, try `MetaWearEnumsSwiftBridges.swift`.
